python jacksession manager
==========================

This is a simple sessionmanager for the new jack-session protocol.

install with:
python setup.py install


it was reported that it installed to /usr/local for somebody.
you need to manually fix the .service file in this case.

jacksmtray should start the tray app, which controls the sessionmanager daemon.

beware that this is still beta quality code.
so it might happen that the sessionmanager might wait forever for some port to show
up. which would never show up. etc...
